The data for the following [code/](https://github.com/CBeardsworth/watlas_validation/blob/master/code) sections are found in [data/](https://github.com/CBeardsworth/watlas_validation/blob/master/data)), apart from the full filtered movement dataset (used in `1_cleaning and run HMM.R`) as it is too large to be included here. Figures created using this code are stored in `figs/`

- `summaries.R`: produces the tables and results that are present in the manuscript
- `figures.R`: produces all the figures that are within the manuscript and supplementary material, these are then stored in [figs/](https://github.com/CBeardsworth/watlas_validation/blob/master/figs)
